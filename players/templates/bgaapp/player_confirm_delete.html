<!-- File Purpose: (LEGACY) PLAYER DELETE CONFIRMATION FORM - NO LONGER ACTIVE IN THE LIVE APP -->
<!-- This template was originally used to delete Tour PLAYERS through the public site -->
<!-- I DISABLED this functionality to PROTECT PLAYER DATA from being deleted accidentally or malicioussly -->
<!-- All PLAYER data is now managed through the DJANGO Admin Panel ONLY -->
<!-- Template kept for reference and potential internal/admin use in future -->

<!-- In Django templates, anything inside {% %} is a tag: it controls logic, security, or flow -->
<!-- In contrast, {{ }} is used to display dynamic values like the player's name -->


{% extends 'core/base.html' %}

{% block content %}



<!-- HEADER -->
<h1>Delete Player (Disabled in Live App)</h1>

<!-- MESSAGE: Shows the name of the player that would be deleted -->
<!-- {{ object }} automatically renders the string representation of the player model -->
<p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{ object }}"?</p>



<!-- DELETE FORM: This form would POST the deletion request -->
<!-- Form is disabled in practice because the view was removed -->
<form method="post">

  <!-- CSRF protection token -->
  {% csrf_token %}

  <!-- DELETE BUTTON: This would submit the deletion — no longer reachable in production -->
  <button type="submit">Yes, delete</button>
</form>



<!-- CANCEL: Would return to the player’s detail page instead of deleting -->
<a href="{% url 'player_detail' object.pk %}">Cancel</a>
