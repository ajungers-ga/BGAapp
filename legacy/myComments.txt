  File Purpose for legacy/templates/season_details.html = 
  This template displays all BGA Tour events for an individual season dating back to 2019

  I'm using Django's template language to...
  1. Dynamically display event data passed from the season_detail view in legacy/views.py
  2. Extend the shared layout from core/base.html using [% extends %]
  3. Insert this page's content into the shared layout using [% block content %] ... [% endblock %]
  4. Use [% if events %] to conditionally show a message if no events exist â€” which there are none at the time of writing

  Data passed into this template = 
  - season: the current year 
  - events: a list of Event objects filtered by that season & ordered by date
